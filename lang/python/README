Help on package gdp:

NAME
    gdp

DESCRIPTION
    A Python API for libgdp. Uses ctypes and shared library versions of
    libgdp and libep.
    
    This package exports two classes, and a few utility functions.
    - GDP_NAME:     represents names in GDP
    - GDP_GCL :     represents a GCL file handle
    
    The first thing that you will need to do is call `gdp_init`. `gdp_init` 
    sets up the connection to a remote `gdp_router`. Example:
    
    ```
    gdp_init("127.0.0.1", 8007)
    ```
    
    Next, you would like to have a `GDP_NAME` object that represents the 
    names in GDP. The reason for a `GDP_NAME` object is that each name can
    have multiple representations.
    
    To create a `GDP_NAME`, use the following:
    ```
    gcl_name = GDP_NAME(some_name)
    ```
    `some_name` could be either a human readable name that is then hashed
    using SHA256, or it could be an internal name represented as a python
    binary string, or it could also be a printable GDP name. (For more
    details on this, look at the C API documentation)
    
    Once you have the GDP_NAME, you can use it to open `GDP_GCL` objects,
    which behave like a file handle in some certain sense.
    
    The unit of reading/writing from a `GDP_GCL` is a datum, which is a
    python dictionary. `GDP_GCL` supports append, reading by record number,
    or subscriptions. For more details, look at the sample programs
    provided.

gdp.GDP_NAME = class GDP_NAME
 |  Represents name of a GCL. Each GCL has potentially up to three kind of 
 |  names:
 |      - a 256 bit binary name
 |      - a Base-64(ish) representation
 |      - (optional) a more memorable name, which potentially is hashed to 
 |        get the binary name
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, name)
 |      takes either an internal name, or a printable name, or a human friendly
 |          name, and creates a python object that can be passed around for the
 |          various GDP calls
 |  
 |  internal_name(self)
 |      Returns a python string that represents the internal binray name
 |  
 |  is_valid(self)
 |      Borrowed from the GDP C api, tells if the name is valid or not
 |  
 |  printable_name(self)
 |      Returns a python string that represents the printable name
 |

 |  Data and other attributes defined here:
 |  
 |  PNAME_LEN = 43
 |  
 |  name_t = <class 'gdp.GDP_NAME.c_ubyte_Array_32'>
 |  
 |  
 |  pname_t = <class 'gdp.GDP_NAME.c_ubyte_Array_44'>

gdp.GDP_GCL = class GDP_GCL
 |  A class that represents a GCL handle. A GCL handle resembles an open
 |      file handle in various ways. However, it is still different in
 |      certain ways
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __del__(self)
 |      close this GCL handle, and free the allocated resources
 |  
 |  __init__(self, name, iomode)
 |      Open a GCL with given name and io-mode
 |      Creating new GCL's is no longer supported.
 |      
 |      name=<name-of-gcl>, iomode=<mode>
 |      name is a GDP_NAME object
 |      mode is one of the following: GDP_MODE_ANY, GDP_MODE_RO, GDP_MODE_AO
 |  
 |  append(self, datum_dict)
 |      Write a datum to the GCL. The datum should be a dictionary, with
 |          the only valid key being 'data'. The value is the actual 
 |          data that is to be written
 |  
 |  getname(self)
 |      Get the name of this GCL, returns a GDP_NAME object
 |  
 |  multiread(self, start, numrecs)
 |      Multiread. Refer to the C-API for details.
 |      For now, callbacks are not exposed to end-user. Events are
 |          generated instead.
 |  
 |  print_to_file(self, fh, detail, indent)
 |      Print this GDP object to a file. Could be sys.stdout
 |          The actual printing is done by the C library
 |  
 |  read(self, recno)
 |      Returns a datum dictionary. The dictionary has the following keys:
 |          - recno: the record number for this GDP
 |          - ts   : the timestamp, which itself is a dictionary with the keys
 |                      being tv_sec, tv_nsec, tv_accuracy
 |          - data : the actual data associated with this datum.
 |  
 |  subscribe(self, start, numrecs, timeout)
 |      Subscriptions. Refer to the C-API for more details
 |      For now, callbacks are not exposed to end-user. Events are 
 |          generated instead.
 |  
 |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |  Class methods defined here:
 |  
 |  get_next_event(cls, timeout) from __builtin__.classobj
 |      Get the events for any open GCL.
