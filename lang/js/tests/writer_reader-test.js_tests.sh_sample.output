Tests of writer-test.js and reader-test.js
{Sat Nov  8 22:22:21 PST 2014

# These tests exercise the above JS GDP test programs.  The tests here
# are NOT completely automatic giving, say, a Passed/Not Passed disposition.
#
# User interaction is required to interpret the results by manually
# checking the consistency of the output of programs run during this test
# with pre-recorded known good output files.  See the result of diffs below.
#

# Here's a reminder of writer-test.js and reader-test.js command line interface
#
# Usage:
# node ./writer-test.js [-a] [-D dbgspec] [-G gdpd_addr] <gcl_name>
#
# Usage:
# node ./reader-test.js [-D dbgspec] [-f firstrec] [-G gdpd_addr] [-m] [-n nrecs] [-s] <gcl_name>

We assume that we are running in gdp/lang/js/test/
pwd = /Users/ada/Projects/Work/SwarmLab/GDP/swarmlab/gdp/lang/js/tests

We assume the local GCL directory is in the directory: /var/tmp/gcl/

ls -ld /var/tmp/gcl/
drwxr-xr-x  9 ada  wheel  306 Nov  8 22:21 /var/tmp/gcl/

We assume a GDP daemon (gdpd) is NOT currently running.
This program will generate gdp-related error output if one is running.

First, we start a GDP daemon in the background
gdpd.PID = 4031

{=======================================================================
Test 1: writer-test.js creates a new gcl;
        reader-test.js reads it back


Running: node ../apps/writer-test.js test_gcl_01

Running: node ../apps/reader-test.js test_gcl_01

Now compare output from the runs above with known good versions.
These two diffs might show differences because of odd file output
versus terminal output buffering differences of these Node.js JS
programs.  If unexpected differences do appear, verify the programs
manually inside of separate Terminal windows.  See comments within
this script for more details.

Test 1: Done
=======================================================================}

{=======================================================================
Test 2: reader-test.js subscribes to an existing gcl
        writer-test.js appends to that existing gcl


Running: node ../apps/reader-test.js -s test_gcl_01 in background
readerSubscribe.PID = 4052

Running: node ../apps/writer-test.js -a test_gcl_01


Check to see if all the appends have been made to the gcl.
Read the newly appended gcl starting with the first record (-f 1)
Running: node ../apps/reader-test.js -f 1 test_gcl_01

We now kill the reader subscribe process, PID=4052
Now compare output from the runs above with known good versions.
These two diffs might show differences because of buffering oddities.
See the comments above in Test 1 and within this script.

>>>>>>>> Checking writer-test.js -a output
diff wr-test_02_WAPPoutput.tmp wr-test_02_WAPPoutput_Good.txt

>>>>>>>> Checking reader-test.js -s output
This diff, in particular is likely to show buffering-related differences.
diff wr-test_02_RSUBoutput.tmp wr-test_02_RSUBoutput_Good.txt

Now compare output from the reading the fully appended gcl with a
known good version.

We now kill the GDP daemon, PID=4031
