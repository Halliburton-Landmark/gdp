    <h1>Global Data Plane Daemon Internals</h1>
    2014-10-04<br>
    <p>This document describes the internals of the Global Data Plane
      (GDP) daemon (gdpd) at a conceptual level.&nbsp; It will also
      describe the hooks provided at the GDP library level for use by
      gdpd.&nbsp; See also the Global Data Plane Library Implementation
      document.<br>
    </p>
    <h2> Overview</h2>
    <p>Following are the major subsystems in gdpd:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Main Loop.</li>
      <li>Thread Pool.</li>
      <li>Protocol Processing.</li>
      <li>GCL Caching.</li>
      <li>Publish/Subscribe.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Physical Log Implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>GCLs piggyback on the GCL implementation in the gdp library, with
      the addition of several fields accessed via the "x" pointer in
      <code> gdp_gcl_t</code>.&nbsp; The gdpd must use a special routine
      (<code>gcl_alloc</code>) to allocate the standard structure
      together with the extension structure.&nbsp; Generally <code>gcl_alloc</code>
      is called via <code>gcl_open</code>, which also opens the
      physical underlying log.<br>
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Module Details</h2>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Main Loop</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/gdpd.c</code>.&nbsp; Besides the main
      event loop, this file includes startup, initialization, and
      connection management.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The GDP daemon is implemented as an event loop using libevent2,
      just like the GDP library.&nbsp; However, it has a separate thread
      running its main event loop.&nbsp; The primary purpose of that
      thread is to listen for incoming connections to the GDP daemon
      port and commands on the resulting sockets.&nbsp; When a command
      is received on a control socket the packet is read in, converted
      to a request, and then passed off to a thread from a pool for
      processing.&nbsp; That thread dispatches the command and sends a
      return response.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Thread Pool</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/thread_pool.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Protocol Processing</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/gdpd_proto.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The main entry point to the protocol processing is <code>dispatch_cmd</code>.&nbsp;
      This procedure invokes the specific code to implement each command
      and processes the results.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each command procedure (all named <code>cmd_</code>*) must get
      any necessary GCL handle, process the command, and release the GCL
      handle using <code>_gdp_gcl_decref</code>.&nbsp; See below for
      specifics of each command.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>GCL Caching</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/gdpd_gcl.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The gdpd GCL cache is tightly integrated with the gdp library GCL
      cache.&nbsp; The major differences are:<br>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>GCLs in gdpd are included in a list sorted by last usage; this
        facilitates cleaning up resources using an LRU algorithm.&nbsp;
        They also have a "last usage time" using a standard Unix <code>time_t</code>
        (resolution one second).<br>
      </li>
      <li>GCLs in gdpd have the information needed to access the
        physical log on disk.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Wrappers allocate and manipulate both the standard GCL and the
      extensions:<br>
    </p>

          </td>
          <td valign="top">Allocates a new GCL handle including the
            extended data, opens the physical underlying GCL, and links
            it into the <code>GclsByUse</code> list (ordered by last
            usage).&nbsp; It sets the free function to <code>gcl_close</code>
            so any further deallocations will release other resources.<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td valign="top"><code>gcl_close</code><br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Removes the GCL from the <code>GclsByUse</code>
            list, drops it from the GCL associative cache (maintained by
            the GDP library), and releases the resources used by the
            physical log (memory and open file descriptors).<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>

          </td>
          <td valign="top">Moves the GCL to the head (most recently used
            end) of the <code>GclsByUse</code> list and updates the
            timestamp.<br>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td valign="top"><code>get_open_handle</code><br>
          </td>
          <td valign="top">Searches for a named GCL in the GCL name →
            handle associative cache; if found, touches it and
            returns.&nbsp; Otherwise, calls <code>gcl_open</code> to
            create a new GCL handle.<br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The usual path for deallocation is to call the GDP Library
      function
      <code> _gdp_gcl_decref</code> to decrement the reference count on
      the GCL.&nbsp; If it reaches zero, that GCL is a candidate for
      being reclaimed.&nbsp; Another cleanup thread periodically
      reclaims idle resources by calling the GDP library function <code>_gdp_gcl_freehandle</code>,
      which in turn calls the associated free function; in gdpd this is
      <code>gcl_close</code>, as described above.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Publish/Subscribe</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/gdpd_pubsub.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Physical Log</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdpd/gdpd_physlog.c</code> and <code>gdpd/gdp_circular_buffer.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Command Processing</h2>
    <p>This section describes specifics of various command
      implementations.&nbsp; All commands are responsible for
      decrementing the reference counts on any GCL they are using before
      they return except as noted below.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Create</h3>
    <p>Create instantiates a new physical GCL.&nbsp; It first allocates
      a handle, then asks the physical layer to do the hard work.&nbsp;
      If that fails it has to recover by freeing the new handle using <code>_gdp_gcl_freehandle</code>;
      otherwise it returns status after (like nearly all commands)
      decrementing the reference count.&nbsp; It may not seem to make
      sense to create a GCL and immediately return the reference count
      on the handle to zero, which is why it is important that GCL
      handles are not immediately deallocated when the reference count
      goes to zero.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Open</h3>
    <p>Open opens an existing GCL.&nbsp; GDP will automatically re-open
      a GCL if it is referenced without being open (part of the
      stateless nature of the protocol), but better errors will be
      returned to applications if they open the GCL first, and is a way
      that an app can get metadata such as the number of records already
      in the GCL (returned as the "<code>recno</code>" field).&nbsp;
      This also allows pre-priming of any caches.<br>
    </p>
    <p>There are actually two open calls: <code>cmd_open_ao</code> for
      append-only and <code>cmd_open_ro</code> for read-only.&nbsp;
      Both of these are actually processed by the routine <code>cmd_open_xx</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Close</h3>
    <p>Strictly speaking, close is not necessary, since GCLs will be
      closed automatically.&nbsp; The only advantage is to test for
      possible error conditions.&nbsp; The implementation is a bit funky
      in that if the GCL handle is not already in the cache it will open
      the GCL and immediately abandon it.&nbsp; This is purely a matter
      of implementation simplicity.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Read</h3>
    <p>The <code>cmd_read</code> routine fetches a single record from a
      physical GCL and returns it.&nbsp; The user must provide the
      record number (i.e., there is no such thing as the concept of
      cursors for this interface).&nbsp; It will return a "not found"
      error if the record does not exist — hence, when reading
      sequentially a "not found" error should be interpreted as "end of
      file".<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Publish</h3>
    <p>Data is written to a GCL using the <code>cmd_publish</code>
      routine.&nbsp; Writing and publishing differ only on whether there
      is a reader that is subscribed to the GCL.&nbsp; In brief, this
      routine writes the data supplied to the physical log and then
      calls <code>sub_notify_all_subscribers</code> to send the new
      data to any subscribers to this GCL.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Subscribe/Multiread</h3>
    <p>Subscribe and Multiread are a bit tricky since they can handle
      several distinct cases.&nbsp; Both of them (potentially) return
      multiple records, with the parameters being the starting record
      number and the number of records.&nbsp; The only difference
      between them is that multiread terminates immediately when there
      is no more data in the GCL, where subscribe waits for new data to
      be added.&nbsp; If the starting record number and the number of
      records only indicates data within the existing GCL, their
      semantics are identical.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Both of them take a starting record number and a number of
      records to return.&nbsp; If the starting record number is negative
      it is an offset from the end of the GCL (e.g., a starting record
      number of –5 starts reading from the fifth most recently written
      record).&nbsp; They both arrange to deliver their records using
      the GDP event interface (note: this is distinct from the events
      used internally in the GDP library and daemon).<br>
    </p>
    <p>Assuming the parameters are acceptable, both commands return
      success immediately, and then start delivering asynchronous
      records through the GDP event interface.&nbsp; Client applications
      get these events by calling <code>gdp_event_next</code>.&nbsp;
      Each event has a type, such as DATA (delivery of a data record) or
      EOS (end of subscription, signalling that no further data will be
      delivered).<br>
    </p>
    <p>After the success notification is delivered for the subscribe or
      multiread command, the routine <code>post_subscribe</code> is
      called.&nbsp; This scans through the existing GCL and delivers all
      data that already exists using the original request (which must
      have a unique request-id to distinguish it).&nbsp; If the data
      runs out before the record count is reached and the command was
      subscribe, the request is then linked onto a subscription chain
      for the GCL; otherwise, if the command was multiread or all the
      data already existed, an EOS (end of subscription) is delivered
      and the request is freed.<br>
    </p>
    <p>These are one of the rare cases where the reference count on the
      GCL is not decremented as the command completes, since there is
      state associated with the subscription that must not be lost [this
      should get fixed someday].<br>
