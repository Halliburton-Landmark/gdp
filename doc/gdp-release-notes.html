    <h1>GDP Release Notes</h1>
    <h2>Release 0.4.0, 2015-10-XXX</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Protocol Version 3, On-Disk version 20151001.&nbsp; <strong>NOTE WELL</strong>:
        because both the on-the-wire and on-disk formats have changed, this
        version is not compatible with existing installations; even old logs are
        incompatible.&nbsp; If you need to transfer data, please contact the GDP
        group.&nbsp; Old clients will not interoperate with new servers and vice
        versa.</li>
      <li>Various naming changes for consistency.&nbsp; Most of these are
        uncommonly used and/or have back compatibility synonyms.</li>
      <li>Implement asynchronous writes.&nbsp; Use these with caution: the
        actual status is returned as a <code>GDP_EVENT_ASTAT</code> event
        rather than a status code, so you must periodically read the events to
        prevent the event queue from filling up.&nbsp; Also, if writes are
        re-ordered in transit you may get signature failures.</li>
      <li>Append operations support signing.&nbsp; This includes several
        changes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>The gcl-create command will create a key pair when the log is
          created.&nbsp; It has several new flags:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><code>-k <span style="font-style: italic;">type</span></code>
            &mdash; set the type of the key pair.&nbsp; May be "rsa", "dsa",
            "ec", or "none" to disable associating a key pair with the
            log.&nbsp; Defaults to the value of the <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.sign.alg</code>
            parameter, or "ec" if that is not set.</li>
          <li><code>-K <span style="font-style: italic;">path</span></code>
            &mdash; set the name of an existing secret key file (if that file
            exists) or the name into which to write the new secret key
            file.&nbsp; This may be a path to a directory, in which case the
            secret key is written into a filed named with the log name in that
            directory.&nbsp; Defaults to the value of the <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.key.dir</code>
            parameter, or "<code>./KEYS</code>" if that is not set.</li>
          <li><code>-b <span style="font-style: italic;">bits</span></code>
            &mdash; sets the key size in bits (RSA and DSA only).&nbsp; Defaults
            to the value of the<span style="font-family: monospace;"> </span><code>swarm.gdp.crypto.rsa.keylen</code>
            or <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.dsa.keylen</code> parameter (as
            appropriate), or 2048 if that parameter is not set.</li>
          <li><code>-c <span style="font-style: italic;">curve</span></code>
            &mdash; sets the name of the elliptic curve (EC only).&nbsp;
            Defaults to the value of the <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.ec.curve
              parameteter</code>, or "sect283r1" if that is not set.&nbsp; This
            curve is compatible with the ATECC108A chip, available on the
            BeagleBone Crypto Cape.</li>
          <li><code>-h <span style="font-style: italic;">hashalg</span></code>
            &mdash; sets the hash algorithm to use.&nbsp; May be "sha1",
            "sha224", "sha256", "sha384", or "sha512".&nbsp; Defaults to the
            value of the <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.hash.alg</code> parameter, or
            "sha256" if that is not set.</li>
          <li><code>-e <span style="font-style: italic;">type</span></code>
            &mdash; set the type of the symmetric encryption algorithm used to
            encrypt the secret key.&nbsp; May be "aes128", "aes192", "aes256",
            "camellia128", "camellia192", "camellia256", "des", "3des", "idea",
            or "none".&nbsp; If "none", the secret key is written to disk
            unencrypted.&nbsp; Defaults to the value of the <code>swarm.gdp.crypto.keyenc.alg</code>
            parameter, or "aes192" if not specified.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Several new administrative parameters provide signing defaults (see
          above).</li>
        <li>The GDP on-the-wire protocol has been updated to accommodate
          signatures.</li>
        <li>The on-disk format has been updated to accommodate signatures.</li>
        <li>The gdplogd server accepts a new -s flag to set how strict it is
          about signatures.&nbsp; The value can be "verify" (if present the
          signature must verify, but unsigned appends will still work),
          "required" (if a public key exists, the signature must be included),
          and "pubkey" (a public key must exist on the log).&nbsp; These can be
          combined; for example, "<code>-s required,verify</code>" indicates
          that logs that have a public key must have a signature and it must be
          valid, but writes to a log that does not have an associated public key
          are still accepted.&nbsp; Defaults to the value of the <code>swarm.gdplogd.crypto.strictness</code>
          parameter, or "verify" if that is not set.&nbsp; This default is
          likely to change in the future.&nbsp; Note that the <code>-s</code>
          flag may increase the strictness but never lower it.</li>
        <li>The libep API has been extended to include cryptography support.</li>
        <li><strong>NOTE WELL</strong>: since the record number is included in
          the signature, the "single writer" model is now enforced; that is, you
          can't have two programs writing a single log at the same time.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><code>gdplogd</code> taks a new <code>-N</code> flag to set the
        routing name.</li>
      <li><code>log-view</code> <code>-r</code> parameter changed to <code>-vv</code>
        (or <code>-vvv</code> for even more information).</li>
      <li><code>log-view</code> extended to show new on-disk information.</li>
      <li>When logs are created, their creation time is noted in the metadata.</li>
      <li>Create man pages for at least some of the command line programs.</li>
      <li>New open mode <code>GDP_MODE_RA</code> allows simultaneous reading
        from and appending to a log.</li>
      <li>Add <code>log-mirror</code> command to allow mirroring of one log
        into another.&nbsp; This program is not robust; use it carefully.</li>
      <li>Read and append filter hooks are now included.&nbsp; The routines
        gdp_gcl_set_append_filter and gdp_gcl_set_read_filter allow an
        application to specify a callback that is invoked on datums either
        before the data is sent into the GDP (for append) or after the data is
        retrieved from the GDP (for read).&nbsp; These are intended to make it
        easier for applications to support encryption and decryption.&nbsp; Note
        that encryption and decryption are not now (and probably never will be)
        a GDP function.</li>
      <li>Change the on-disk representation of logs to have all numbers in
        network byte order.&nbsp; This allows a raw log to be copied to a
        different endian architecture and still work.</li>
    </ul>
