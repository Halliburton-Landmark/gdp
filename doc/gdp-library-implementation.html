    <h1>Global Data Plane Library Implementation</h1>
    2014-10-04<br>
    <p>This document describes the internals of the Global Data Plane
      (GDP) run-time library at a conceptual level.&nbsp; This library
      is linked into any client that wishes to participate in the Global
      Data Plane.&nbsp; The base library is implemented in C, which is
      what this document will assume, but bindings for the external
      interfaces are available for other languages.&nbsp; See the
      document Global Data Plane Programmatic API for details of that
      interface.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>To be completed.<br>
      Main modules:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>API.</li>
      <li>Packet assembly/disassembly.</li>
      <li>Datum management.<br>
      </li>
      <li>I/O buffering.</li>
      <li>GCL associative cache.</li>
      <li>GDP protocol.</li>
      <li>Request management.</li>
      <li>Event loop.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Generally speaking, the GDP library is structured as an
      event-driven program with a synchronous API.&nbsp; One thread
      services events (e.g., responses from the GDP daemon) while the
      main thread executes the user application.&nbsp; When the
      application needs to contact the daemon, it sends the message and
      then waits on a condition variable until signaled.&nbsp; In the
      meantime, the event look will wait for a response, associate it
      with the appropriate GCL handle on the basis of the GCL
      associative cache, and then signal the application to collect the
      results.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Data is exchanged through a data structure of type <code>gdp_datum_t</code>,
      which contains a record number a time stamp, and a data
      buffer.&nbsp; When sending data to the GDP daemon, the application
      creates a datum, fills it in with data, and sends it to the
      daemon.&nbsp; When receiving data from the GDP daemon, the
      application passes a datum into the GDP library that will be
      filled in.&nbsp; Generally when sending data to the daemon the
      record number and time stamp are ignored and replaced with the
      real record number and timestamp after the write completes.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Important Data Types and Structures</h2>
    <h2>Module Details</h2>
    <h3>API</h3>
    <p>The API module (<code>gdp/gdp_api.c</code>) defines all the
      externally visible routines.&nbsp; Since these are already
      documented in the GDP Programmatic API document, suffice it to say
      that it does the "translation" between the internal protocol and
      the external API.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Request Management</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_req.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Internally the data flow is managed through a series of
      requests.&nbsp; In many cases there will be only one request
      active on a given GCL at a time, but this is not necessarily true,
      especially in the GDP daemon when handling subscriptions (each
      subscription is a separate request).&nbsp; Requests (potentially)
      have a pointer to a GCL handle, a pointer to a data packet (in
      internal form), the status code from the operation embodied in the
      request, and special information for use when processing
      subscriptions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The internal routines are:<br>

    <h3>GCL Associative Cache</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_gcl.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The primary purpose of the GCL Associative Cache is to allow
      quick association between a GCL name and the associated
      handle.&nbsp; When a packet is received that contains a GCL name,
      this delivers the handle that contains the necessary state
      information.<br>

            becomes a candidate for cleanup, but this is deferred

            will appear shortly.<br>

            (this is used by the GDP daemon).&nbsp; It then frees the

    <h3>Packets</h3>
    Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_pkt.c</code>.<br>
    <br>
    Packets are marshalled and demarshalled in <code>gdp/gdp_pkt.c</code>.&nbsp;
    Each packet has the following fields (with the number of octets for
    the field):<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Protocol version (1).</li>
      <li>Command or Ack/Nak (1).</li>
      <li>Flags (1).&nbsp; These indicate the presence of the optional
        fields.</li>
      <li>Reserved for future use (must be zero when sending, ignored on
        receive) (1).</li>
      <li>Length of data portion (4).</li>
      <li>Request ID (4, optional).</li>
      <li>GCL name (32, optional).</li>
      <li>Record number (8, optional).</li>
      <li>Commit timestamp (16, optional).</li>
      <li>Data (as indicated by the length field).<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>One field is used to indicate both commands and
      acknowledgements/negative acknowledgements.&nbsp; See the comments
      in <code>gdp/gdp_pkt.h</code> for the details of those values.&nbsp;
      This is worth emphasizing: the command field in the protocol
      encodes both imperative commands (e.g., "write this data") and
      responses ("that data was written" or "could not write that
      data").&nbsp; Both forms are described in the code as "commands",
      and even share a single dispatch table.<br>
    </p>

          <td valign="top">Given a packet structure and an output
            buffer, converts that packet to external format and writes
            it to the buffer.&nbsp; Under normal circumstances this
            buffer is associated with an I/O channel, and hence is
            written to the communication socket automatically.<br>

            Under most cases it should be called in a loop until a
            successful status is returned.&nbsp; As with <code>_gdp_pkt_out</code>,
            the I/O buffer is normally associated with an I/O
            channel.&nbsp; See the discussion of the event loop for more

    <br>
    <h3>GDP Protocol</h3>
    <p>Implemented in <code>gdp/gdp_proto.c</code>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The basic model is that clients create a request with <code>_gdp_req_new</code>
      which contains a command (what they need to get done) and
      optionally a pointer to a GCL handle on which to perform the
      operation, the connection on which to operate, and some flag
      bits.&nbsp; They may fill in other information associated with a
      request, such as the record number for a read command.&nbsp; The
      client then calls <code>_gdp_invoke</code>, passing it the
      request.&nbsp; That routine in turn sends the request using <code>_gdp_req_send</code>;
      assuming that works it waits on the condition variable contained
      in the request to get the final return status and returns that.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The sending part, implemented by <code>_gdp_req_send</code>,
      links the request to the requesting GCL (so it can be found when
      the reply eventually comes in), makes sure that the GCL name is in
      the associative name → handle cache, and sends the packet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>When the reply message eventually comes in, it triggers an event
      in the main I/O loop; that is handed to (another) thread for
      processing.&nbsp; This is done through the bufferevent interface,
      part of libevent2, which invokes callbacks when events happen on
      sockets (that is, it can be considered as having a similar
      functionality to select, or more accurately <code>kqueue</code>
      or <code>/dev/poll</code>).&nbsp; The primary callback used is <code>gdp_read_cb</code>.&nbsp;
      That routine allocates a new packet and reads a packet into that
      area.&nbsp; If the packet is incomplete (i.e., it hasn't all been
      read in) the packet is freed and the callback returns (it will be
      called again later when more of the packet is read).&nbsp; If the
      entire packet is available, it calls <code>process_packet</code>
      to interpret it.<br>
    </p>
    <p>[The code currently has a non-functional #ifdef for <code>GDP_PACKET_QUEUE</code>.&nbsp;
      This is for a future extension allowing the packet to be dropped
      into another queue for interpretation from a process in the thread
      pool so that the read thread can focus entirely on reading and
      handing off packets.&nbsp; This technique is already used in gdpd,
      and will only be used in the client library if necessary for
      performance.]<br>
    </p>
    <p>Packet processing in process_packet involves finding the
      associated GCL, if available, and from that finding the associated
      request.&nbsp; If no request is found a new request is created;
      this is the case with spontaneous commands.&nbsp; There is some
      processing of datums to handle the case where a request had an
      existing datum that needs to be replaced with a new one (for
      example, a read request that passed in a datum with the record
      number and returns a datum with the associated timestamp and data;
      since the read API passes in the datum, there is some shuffling
      necessary with the underlying data buffers so that the caller can
      actually access the returned data).&nbsp; The request (now a
      response) is then passed to <code>_gdp_req_dispatch</code> for
      processing.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Processing in <code>_gdp_req_dispatch</code> is done through a
      simple dispatch table indexed by command.&nbsp; Requests can be
      either commands or responses (ack/nak); in most cases, client
      programs should only receive responses, and will get a "not
      implemented" if any commands are received.&nbsp; Responses fall
      into 2½ classes: successes (acks), client naks, and server
      naks.&nbsp; There are several of each of these, which roughly
      correspond to HTTP response codes (2xx, 4xx, and 5xx respectively)
      or CoAP codes (2.xx, 4.xx, and 5.xx).&nbsp; These piggyback on
      three routines (<code>ack_success</code>, <code>nak_client</code>,
      and <code>nak_server</code>), the latter two of which are
      essentially identical, doing nothing but passing the error on up
      the stack.&nbsp; The ack_success routine checks for some
      nonsensical situations and passes the (interpreted) status back up
      to process_packet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The response from the command is then interpreted by <code>process_packet</code>.&nbsp;
      There are two cases.&nbsp; The simpler one is when the
      command/response was a simple ack/nak, in which case the status is
      stored in the request and the thread waiting on that request is
      poked to wake up.&nbsp; The other case is when the request is a
      subscription, in which case this request (which in this case must
      be a response) must be turned into an event.&nbsp; If so, a new
      event is created and passed off to the event subsystem for
      delivery (described elsewhere).<br>
    </p>
    <h4>Response Confusion</h4>
    <p>One major confusion results from the large variety of response
      codes from various existing subsystems.&nbsp; One common status
      encoding is HTTP status codes and CoAP status codes.&nbsp; These
      overlap (mostly), so we can (mostly) treat them as the same
      thing.&nbsp; They are the primary mode of passing protocol status
      in the GDP protocol, but since those response are only eight bits
      the codes are offset: HTTP/COAP codes 200–264 become commands
      128–191, codes 400–432 become commands 192–223, and codes 500–531
      become commands 224–254.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Internally the GDP library uses the <code>EP_STAT</code>
      abstraction as a lingua franca.&nbsp; <code>EP_STAT</code>s allow
      encoding of response codes in a single integer (so they can be
      passed easily back from functions).&nbsp; Those integers encode a
      severity (most importantly, success or failure), a registry and a
      module identifier (which for this purpose can be treated as one
      piece), and detail information.&nbsp; The module is used to create
      broad categories: for example, one module corresponds to Unix
      errnos, allowing them to be passed back directly.&nbsp; Another
      module is specific to the GDP.&nbsp; There are several generic
      status codes defined in <code>gdp/gdp_stat.h</code> such as <code>GDP_STAT_KEEP_READING</code>
      (a warning that a partial packet has been read but the remainder
      remains to be read) or <code>GDP_STAT_CORRUPT_GCL</code> (a

    <h3>Event Processing</h3>
    <p>Events (see <code>gdp/gdp_event.c</code>) are a way of
      delivering information to a client without using an RPC-style
      blocking response.&nbsp; Specifically, a client can issue several
      commands and then wait for the responses to come in an arbitrary
      order.&nbsp; The implementation is simple: as messages are read
      that cannot be immediately processed they are turned into
      events.&nbsp; Those events are linked onto an active list.&nbsp;
      The client can collect events using <code>gdp_event_next</code>,
      which takes them off the active queue.&nbsp; The client is
      responsible for freeing them using <code>gdp_event_free</code>.<br>
