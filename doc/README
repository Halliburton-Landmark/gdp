*** NOTE WELL: The .dbk files are now obsolete; they've been moved to
Google Docs.  Versions are also available on the SwarmLab web site.
These are here for historic purposes only.

The exception is Libep.dbk, which is still the current version.

If you still want to generate PDFs from the .DBK documents, install
the following packages:
    xsltproc
    docbook-xsl-ns
    docbook5-xml
    fop

The docbook5-xml material should be available at
https://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/xml/5.0b5/, or alternatively at
http://docbook.org/xml/5.0 (better documentation here).  See also
http://docbook.org/tdg51/en/html/appa.html for installation advice.

TO BE DONE: more description of printing Docbook.
