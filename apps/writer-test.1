.Sh NAME
.Nm writer-test
.Nd write to a GDP log
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl a
.Op Fl D debug-spec
.Op Fl G router-ip
.Op Fl L log-file
.Ar log-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads data from the standard input and writes it to the GDP log
.Ar log-name .
The log must already exist.
.Pp
If the log has a public key included in the metadata
(see
.Xr gcl-create 8 )
then
.Nm
will try to find a corresponding secret key in the filesystem.
It searches for a file named with the internal (256 bit) name of the log
as represented in
base64url
format with a
.Sy \&.pem
file extension containing the secret key
and uses that for signing writes.
See the description of the
.Sy swarm.gdp.crypto.key.path
parameter in
.Sx ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
for details on the search path.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Fl a
Use asynchronous writes.
This is primarily for testing.
.It Fl D debug-spec
Turn on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Only useful with code in hand.
.It Fl G router-ip
Contact the given IP address (which may be a DNS name)
to get a connection to the GDP routing layer.
This will be replaced by automatic discovery
(for example, using Zeroconf)
soon.
The address may have an optional port number after a colon.
If this is not specified,
the names listed in the
.Va swarm.gdp.routers
runtime administrative parameter
are searched.
.It Fl L log-file
If set, write a very simplistic performance log to the given
.Ar log-file .
This can be used together with the companion flag on
.Xr reader-test 1
to produce crude round-trip performance numbers.
