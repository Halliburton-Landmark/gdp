To run the *.js tests:
----------------------

Copy all the .js and .html files to the root directory of your webserver
Configure SCGI and gdp-rest

TODO:

Allow running tests without user interaction

To run the the gdp-rest-testcases.py tests:
-------------------------------------------

# The gdp-rest-01.eecs.berkeley.edu host is servicing real GDP
# requests on the /gdp/v1/gcl URI using installed gdp binaries, but
# also supports development work. HTTP requests on the /gdp/v2/gcl URI
# are directed to development binaries in a developer's git workspace,
# when properly configured to do so (see below).

# The gdp-rest-01.eecs.berkeley.edu host is not serving as a permanent
# home for GCLs. For development and test purposes, gdplogd is started
# befores the test suite run, but is always stopped at the end of each
# test run, after which all GCLs are cleaned off gdp-rest-01! Since
# active keys will be on gdp-rest-01 permanently, care should be taken
# to only clean up test keys! TODO: given the live and test
# binaries/libraries on the same host, it has proven difficult to
# isolate the test bed completely without cutting off the production
# services too; it would perhaps be useful to enhance gdp_init() so
# development binaries could selectively limit or disable zeroconf
# discovery of the real GDP.
