.Sh NAME
.Nm gdp-name-add
.Nd add entry to human-oriented to GDP-oriented name directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gdp-name-add
.Op Fl D Ar debug-spec
.Op Fl H Ar database-host-name
.Op Fl p Ar database-password
.Op Fl P Ar database-password-file
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl u Ar database-user-name
.Ar human-name
.Ar gdp-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
adds an entry to the mapping database for
.Ar human-name
to
.Ar gdp-name.
GDPnames are represented as base64-encoded 256-bit tokens;
human names are arbitrary user-supplied text,
typically formatted as a reversed DNS-style name,
e.g.,
.Dq edu.berkeley.eecs.eric.test.01 .
.Pp
The password for the
.Ar database-user-name
is read from the keyboard.
This does
.Em not
use the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.passwd
administrative parameter since that is for the account that reads the database,
not the account that writes the database.
.Pp
This is strictly for debugging and administration;
the log creation service should do this for ordinary users.
.Ss "Warning"
This implementation is likely to change or go away entirely in the future,
and the command will probably be subsumed into a swarm service.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.
.It Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turns on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
.
.It Fl H Ar database-host-name
The DNS name of the host that maintains the database.
This overrides the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.host
runtime administrative parameter.
.
.It Fl p Ar database-password
The password for the database account used to update the database.
If this is not set, the
.Fl P
is is consulted.
.
.It Fl P Ar database-password-file
The name of a file containing the database password.
This is more secure than using
.Fl p
since the password will not show up in a
.Xr ps 1
output.
If not specified,
defaults to the value of the
.Va swarm.gdp.creation-service.passwd-file
administrative parameter,
which in turn defaults to
.Pa /etc/gdp/creation_service_pw.txt .
If this file cannot be read,
the command invoker will be prompted for a password.
.
.It Fl u database-user-name
The name of the database user to update the database.
This must have INSERT permission on the mapping table.
Defaults to the value of the
.Va swarm.gdp.creation-service.user
administrative parameter.
Note that this is a different user from that specified in the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.user
parameter.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag
.It Li EX_UNAVAILABLE
The database cannot be accessed.
.It Li EX_USAGE
Command line parameters are incorrect.
.El
.Sh ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
.Bl -tag
.
.It swarm.gdp.creation-service.user
The name of the database user with permissions to update the
human-oriented name to GDPname database.
Defaults to
.Li gdp_creation_service .
.
.It swarm.gdp.creation-service.passwd-file
The name of the default password file.
This can be overridden using the
.Fl P
flag.
Defaults to
.Pa /etc/gdp/creation_service_pw.txt .

See
.Xr gdp 7
for documentation for
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.host ,

and
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.table .

Should have some easy but reasonably secure way of reading the password
for the update user without resorting to the keyboard.
