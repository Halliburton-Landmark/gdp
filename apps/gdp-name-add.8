.Sh NAME
.Nm gdp-name-add
.Nd add entry to human-oriented to GDP-oriented name directory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gdp-name-add
.Op Fl D Ar debug-spec
.Op Fl H Ar database-host-name
.Op Fl u Ar database-user-name
.Ar human-name
.Ar gdp-name
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
adds an entry to the mapping database for
.Ar human-name
to
.Ar gdp-name.
GDPnames are represented as base64-encoded 256-bit tokens;
human names are arbitrary user-supplied text,
typically formatted as a reversed DNS-style name,
e.g.,
.Dq edu.berkeley.eecs.eric.test.01 .
.Pp
The password for the
.Ar database-user-name
is read from the keyboard.
This does
.Em not
use the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.passwd
administrative parameter since that is for the account that reads the database,
not the account that writes the database.
.Pp
This is strictly for debugging and administration;
the log creation service should do this for ordinary users.
.Ss "Warning"
This implementation is likely to change or go away entirely in the future,
and the command will probably be subsumed into a swarm service.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.
.It Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turns on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
.
.It Fl H Ar database-host-name
The DNS name of the host that maintains the database.
This overrides the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.host
runtime administrative parameter.
.
.It Fl u database-user-name
The name of the database user to update the database.
This must have INSERT permission on the mapping table.
Defaults to
.Li creation_service .
Note that this is a different user from that specified in the
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.user
parameter.
.El
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Bl -tag
.It Li EX_UNAVAILABLE
The database cannot be accessed.
.It Li EX_USAGE
Command line parameters are incorrect.

.Sh ADMINISTRATIVE PARAMETERS
See
.Xr gdp 7
for documentation for
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.host ,
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.database ,
and
.Va swarm.gdp.hongdb.table .

Should have some easy but reasonably secure way of reading the password
for the update user without resorting to the keyboard.
